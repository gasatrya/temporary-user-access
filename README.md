**GateFlow** is a lightweight, security-focused WordPress plugin that automates the lifecycle of guest accounts. It allows site administrators to set expiration dates for users, ensuring that temporary access (for contractors, contributors, or trial users) is revoked automatically, keeping the site secure and the database clean.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Automated Offboarding** — Set an expiry date during user creation or editing.
-   **Manual Revocation** — Instantly kill access for any user by switching their status to "Expired".
-   **Strict Access Control** — Expired users are blocked from logging in immediately.
-   **Smart Cookie Expiration** — Temporary users get a forced 1-hour session limit to ensure frequent re-validation of their status.
-   **Auto-Deletion System** — Automatically remove expired users after a configurable grace period.
-   **Content Preservation** — Posts and comments from deleted users are safely reassigned to a primary administrator.
-   **Admin Immunity** — Built-in protection to prevent administrators from being accidentally expired or deleted.
-   **Modern Architecture** — Fully namespaced, object-oriented code following PHP 8 standards.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

-   **PHP:** 8.0+ (Namespaced, Singleton Pattern, Manual PSR-4 Autoloading).
-   **WordPress:** 6.4+ (Utilizes Metadata API, CRON API, and User API).
-   **JavaScript:** Vanilla jQuery (WordPress Admin standards).
-   **CSS:** Native CSS3 for color-coded status badges.
